This is a list of things that need to be done.

- Implement effective multithreading for xmlGraph.py

- Use NetworkX to convert the XML data into Giraph readable edge list

- Implement a MR job in python that can find n where a collaboration between two authors is their nth collaboration (i.e. given some collaboration, is this their 3rd, 4th,.. collaboration?)

- Setup use for AWS
